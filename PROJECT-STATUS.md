# Databricks Fraud Detection — Project Status

Ecosystem snapshot for this repo. Updated after every meaningful session.
Tracked in git (same convention as `gridpulse-gcp`), so it must stay
public-safe: no account IDs, workspace URLs, cluster IDs, or personal
emails — placeholders only.

## Current phase
Phase 0 in progress (3 of 9 gaps resolved: G-03, G-06, G-07) and Phase 1
scaffolding done, uncommitted as of 2026-09-21. Local git repo initialised (no
remote yet), no cloud resources provisioned, no pipeline code written. The original brief is captured in
`docs/00-initial-brief.md` and is a **non-binding draft**; every stack and
architecture decision is to be re-researched before it is adopted (see
`docs/GAPS.md`).

## Phase status

Provisional — to be replaced by the real plan once Phase 0 research lands.

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Research & decisions (verify open questions, write ADRs) | 🔄 In progress | G-03, G-06, G-07 resolved; drives `docs/GAPS.md` |
| 1 — Scaffolding (git repo, CI, Makefile, per-directory READMEs) | ✅ Done | Makefile untested locally (no `make` installed); CI unrun, no remote |
| 2 — Ingest → Bronze | ⏳ Pending | |
| 3 — Silver + velocity features | ⏳ Pending | |
| 4 — ML training + in-stream scoring | ⏳ Pending | |
| 5 — Gold alerts + Unity Catalog governance | ⏳ Pending | |
| 6 — Monitoring app + Workflows/alerting | ⏳ Pending | |
| 7 — Live demo window + teardown | ⏳ Pending | |

## Last commit
Local scaffold commit only (`git log`); no remote configured yet.

## Metrics

gap map.
